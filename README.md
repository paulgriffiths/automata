# Automata

**automata** is a collection of Golang packages and applications concerning
automata and regular expressions.

The principle purpose of this project is for me to practise writing in Go.

Contents include:

* Data structures to simulate arbitrary deterministic and nondeterministic
finite automata

* Conversion of nondeterministic to deterministic finite automata

* Construction of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata from
regular expressions
