# Automata

**automata** is a collection of Golang packages and applications involving
deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata, and regular expressions.

Contents include:

* Data structures to simulate arbitrary deterministic and nondeterministic
finite automata

* Conversion of nondeterministic to deterministic finite automata

* Construction of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata from
regular expressions using the McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson algorithm.
